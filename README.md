# GraphAL
### Description
GraphAL is a framework for graph algorithms visualization.  
This framework shows how work the ones of the most popular graph algorithms:
- [Depth First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
- [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
- [Floyd–Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm)
- [Bellman-Ford algorithm (beta)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman–Ford_algorithm)
- [Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (beta)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford–Fulkerson_algorithm)
> Beta funcions does not guarantee correct execution!

### How to start
First of all, you should compile two dynamic link library "generation.dll" and "algorithms.dll". Their source code contains in src/generation/ and src/algorithms/ folders appropriately. Those dll files should be in src/ folder. Run app.py.
Have fun!

### Dependencies
- Python v3.8+
- PySimpleGUI v4.19+
